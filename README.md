# Egypt birth analysis

1. Project Description:
This project involves analyzing birth data in Egypt from 2018 to 2023 to uncover patterns and trends in birth registrations, specifically focusing on how certain dates (like January 1st and October 1st) show peaks in births. The analysis aims to explain these trends by exploring societal factors such as school registration systems and registration practices.
The project leverages Python for data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization to gain insights and present findings.

2. Data Source:
the data was provided form the ministry of planning and economic development in Egypt.

3. Technologies Used:
   
Programming Language: Python


Libraries:
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
Jupyter Notebook (for the interactive environment)

4. Analysis and Insights:

The most significant spikes in birth registrations occur on January 1st and October 1st each year. These peaks are largely influenced by administrative and educational policies in Egypt.
January 1st: Registrations spike due to births from late December being recorded in the new year.
October 1st: A notable spike occurs due to parents registering children born before October 15th to ensure they can start school in the same year.
Birth registrations peak on the first day of every month, aligning with the common practice of registering births from the previous month. The last day of each month consistently shows the fewest registrations.

The data shows a steady decline in births between 2018 and 2024, likely driven by factors such as the rising cost of living, later marriage ages, government policies (e.g., Egyptian Family Development), and the impact of COVID-19.

Summer months (Juneâ€“August) show higher daily birth rates on average, while the median number of births remains relatively consistent across most months.

5. Key Steps in the Analysis:
   
Data Cleaning: Removing missing values, correcting inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing birth trends over time.

6. Results/Conclusion:
   
The project highlights how external systems like education and registration practices can influence reported birth trends. By understanding these patterns, governments and organizations can better plan for resources and policies. The project concludes that societal factors such as education policies play a role in birth registration spikes.
